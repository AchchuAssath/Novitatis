                </h2>

                    <span class="section-heading-upper">farm machines</span>
                </h4>
                <p class="mb-3">One of the challenges that farmers face nowadays is the need to satisfy labor. There is an increasing cost of labor, which calls for better approaches to ensure less cost on labor. The introduction of combined harvesters and planters simplifies the process. Production and time are some of the important elements in agriculture. It is important, therefore, to plant early, harvest in time, as well as ensure that the yield is stored within the right time. The use of modern technology in agriculture ensures that farmers grow vast food within the shortest time possible.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">GPS technology has been used in the development of autopilot sprayers and tractors that do not require any driver. Such technology is important in agriculture in that it promotes better and more efficient farming practices. For example, the autopilot tractors and sprayers are equipped with tracking systems that eliminates human error and in the end save on fuel and equipment.</p>

                <h4 class="section-heading mb-4">
                    <span class="section-heading-upper">Crop sensors</span>
                </h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Effective application of fertilizers and pesticides remains to be a big challenge in agriculture especially when it comes to the determination of what fertilizer works best for different plans, when to apply, as well as what quantities. The use of crop sensors can make it easy for farmers to effectively apply fertilizers and pesticides just as much as the crops need. Variable rate technology becomes useful in such cases. Such technology gives you the opportunity to sense how your plants are feeling and subsequently help you reduce the probability of leaching or surface runoff. Crops sensors are designed in a manner that they dictate to the application machinery the amount of the resource that a given crop needs, and at what time.

                <h4 class="section-heading mb-4">
                    <span class="section-heading-upper">Use of GPS in fields documentation</span>
                </h4>
                <p class="mb-3">GPS is becoming a common technology in agriculture. For example, modern agriculture involves the use of GPS to document the status of the farmland. Through the GPS, it is easy to determine and document the yields from a given farm, as well as record the application rates. Such technologies are useful in that the farmers can rely on the collected and recorded data for reference when making any decisions. The recommendable documentation technology is the yield map, which can be used to offer a summary of entire year’s activities. Such maps are highly useful as they can give a wide range of information about just anything such as the status of the drainage system in your field.
                </p>

                <h4 class="section-heading mb-4">
                    <span class="section-heading-upper">Biotechnology</span>
                </h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Biotechnology is also referred to as genetic engineering and the process of improving the genes of a given crop. In most cases, genetic engineering is carried out to increase the resistance of certain crops to farm inputs such the application of herbicides. Through biotechnology, farmers can plant on areas that were otherwise considered dry or deserts. Reduced farm inputs implies that the farmer as well saves on the cost of farm resources.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">Modern agricultural technology hopes to achieve among others, two important goals – profitable economy and better output. It is therefore, important to be careful with the goals and objectives that you set aiming upon the implementation of different technologies in agriculture.  Some of the aspects that you should look at include how to apply and organize fertilizer, irrigation, theatre, intensive tillage, monoculture, and the application of other resources. However, in order to achieve these goals, farmers need to understand the concept of modern farming and the use of technology.</p>
